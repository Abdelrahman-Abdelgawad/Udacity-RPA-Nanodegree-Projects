# Project2 - Invoice Scrapping 


### Description:

A process that will scrape relevant data from the invoices for further processing.
The Robot will read through emails and download the invoices received in the form of an email attachment as a PDF.
It will extract specific data and store those values in an Excel spreadsheet and a subset of values will be uploaded to the Orchestrator Queue.
And finally, the robot will email the spreadsheet to MyEmail when finished.
